            <p>Border security and regional cooperation are vital components in the fight against terrorism. 
                Strengthening border security involves implementing measures to prevent the illegal movement of individuals, 
                weapons, and contraband across borders</p>

  <h2>Attacks in Garissa: towards the precipice</h2>

      <h5 class="card-title">Marginalisation</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Garissa is a borderland. It is hard to understand 
        the peculiar risks it faces without understanding its history. 
        It is both peripheral and significant within Kenya, a contested terrain in which intense 
        rivalries play out between local people and across its boundaries.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="card text-bg-info  col-3">
    <div class="card-header">Differentiate</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">local perceptions of violence</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Shabaab’s attacks in Garissa followed a pattern familiar from elsewhere in Kenya. 
        Aimed at businesses, churches, hotels, security forces and the university, 
        they targeted non-Somali outsiders, who were chosen for reasons local people could identify with. 
        In some cases, such as the killing of a prison guard near the Safari hotel, 
        it is not clear whether an attack was the work of Shabaab or just a settling of local scores.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Rebuilding trust and unity</h5>
      <p class="card-text">It has been observed in other contexts that terror tactics tend to 
        provoke public revulsion that can be self-defeating as long as the response is not disproportionately 
        brutal and indiscriminate. [81] This self-defeating tendency was certainly present in Garissa.</p>

    <div class="card-header">Togetherness</div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">peacebuilding moment</h5>
      <p class="card-text" style="color: white;">Garissa has made undeniable progress. 
        But as one local peace worker explained “Countering violent extremism is short term 
        but peacebuilding is needed for the long term”. [104] This is by no means ‘CVE job done’. 
        All the structural challenges faced by Garissa 
        before the attacks still remain challenges now.</p>
