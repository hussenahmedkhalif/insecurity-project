  <h2>Marginalisation and division in Garissa</h2>
</div>
<div class="container">
  <div class="maj">
    
    <img src="https://www.saferworld-global.org/images/resources/publications/garissa/download-(1).jpg" alt="">
    
    <p>Garissa is a borderland. It is hard to understand the peculiar risks it faces 
      without understanding its history. It is both peripheral and significant within Kenya, 
      a contested terrain in which intense rivalries play out between local people and 
      across its boundaries.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Historically, ethnic Somalis have been the dominant population in Garissa. 
        In the run-up to Kenya’s independence, many believed they would be free to unite with a greater Somalia. 
        When Kenya decided to fold the NFD into Kenya, an armed struggle ensued.
         ‘Shifta’ is a Somali term meaning bandit, and – partly to undermine the struggle – the secessionist
          conflict became known in Kenya as the Shifta War.</p>
          <br>
          <p>This issue matters a great deal. Even for those who have ID, checkpoints and random 
            searches make moving freely a challenge. Without proof of identity, 
            there is no chance of a job as a teacher, a policeman, a soldier or a civil servant, and 
            it is difficult to access government services. As a group of young people explained to us, 
            “There is a general marginalisation from the national government on issuing IDs,
             education and health programmes”. </p>

    <p>A second Kenyan objective was to assert military influence in a context where other 
      regional powers were already getting involved. A third was capturing the port of Kismayo and 
      cutting off Shabaab’s income from the port (estimated at $25 million per year). [35] However, 
      Kismayo lay 300km into Somalia from the Kenyan border. 
      Kenya could not hope to reach it without local support so it worked closely with Madobe’s Ras Kamboni and 
      the Ogaden clansmen of the area in a bloody campaign that eventually routed Shabaab from Kismayo 
      in 2012. In fact, Kenyan forces in Somalia still work closely and share bases with Ras Kamboni 
      to date. </p>

      <p>Historically, ethnic Somalis have been the dominant population in Garissa. 
        In the run-up to Kenya’s independence, many believed they would be free to unite with a greater Somalia.

         ‘Shifta’ is a Somali term meaning bandit, and – partly to undermine the struggle – the secessionist
          conflict became known in Kenya as the Shifta War.</p>
          <br>
          <p>More broadly, given the oil exploration in the disputed maritime waters 
            between Kenya and Somalia, and the need to secure the region surrounding the 
            LAPSSET corridor, the invasion was also economically motivated. [36] Of course, 
            as it turned out, Kenyan intervention failed to prevent Shabaab from taxing goods that 
            passed through Kismayo, [37] and the backlash dramatically destabilised northern and 
            coastal counties like Garissa. </p>
